This python script interacts with Libcloud API to build a VPS (by default at Rackspace Cloud) and install Aegir.

It's then designed to fetch Drush Make stub files from a public URL (such as your github repo of make files) and 
build your projects as platforms, finishing up by doing a test site install on that platform using the relevant
install profile.

Designed to be plugged straight into Jenkins projects as an 'Execute shell' build step, and optionally scheduled
or triggered by changes in your module/install profile's git repo or similar.
